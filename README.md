# SaveTabs
A Chrome extension to save the URLs of all open tabs to a text file.

For this extension to work properly, you must install libraries.

    * https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/8.0.0/normalize.css
    * https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.2/css/bootstrap.min.css
* Download the following scripts and save them into the "lib" directory:
    * https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js
    * https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js

To save incognito tabs, go to chrome://extensions and allow SaveTabs to run in incognito mode. Otherwise, incognito tabs will not be saved, even if the "Save incognito tabs" checkbox is checked.
